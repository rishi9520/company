Project Overview
Build a modern, expansive, multi-section corporate website for "CODICORE PRIVATE LIMITED" — a legally registered tech company in India (CIN: U58200UP2025PTC230810). The website must showcase products (SkoolHub 2.0), company profile, services, technology stack, careers, contact info, and legal certifications.

Technical & Design Requirements
Framework & Language: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and scalable codebase.

Routing: Use Wouter or React Router for client-side routing (multi-section SPA, not single page).

Smooth Scrolling: Implement Lenis.js for ultra-smooth and customizable scrolling effects.

Animations: Use AOS (Animate On Scroll), GSAP, or Framer Motion for beautiful entrance effects, hover animations, text animations, and SVG or canvas animations.

Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for branded color theme; implement dark theme with glass morphism and gradient overlays.

Responsive Design: Mobile-first, fully responsive. Tailwind breakpoints for all device sizes.

Performance: Lazy load images/videos, minimize bundle size, optimize animations for smoothness and low CPU use.

Accessibility: All animations and interactions must be accessible, with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
